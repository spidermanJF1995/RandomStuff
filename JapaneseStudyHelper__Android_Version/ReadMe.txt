(THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS)
 
I am interested in learning Japanese. 

There are some good programs / apps out there but I feel like 
they don't really do what I am wanting them to do. That is why I decided to
create this project. 
 
I do intend to add a lot more to this project than what is in it now.
Hopefully I can learn Japanese with it and maybe one day, others can too.

FEATURES OF APP:

1) Learn the Hiragana and Katakana sets. This can be done either by learning each
	set individually or learning both sets together at once.
	
	1a) After selecting the character set, the user can then choose to learn via
		Alphabetical Order or Free Response. And then, also choose from Multiple Choice
		or Random Order...
		
		My logic is that learning the characters in different ways would engage the brain
		a bit more and thus help with the learning. I have no scientific studies to back
		up that way of thinking but I think it sounds logical. 
		
		Alphabetical Order boosts confidence and exposure while Random Order simulates
		the real world a bit in that the characters will randomly show up.
		
		Multiple Choice and Free Response are just two different ways to engage the brain.
		
2) The app will keep track of missed characters to show them to the user later

	2a) The point of the app is to help study so it makes sense to show the stuff that 
		the user is having trouble with.
		
3) Learn Kanji and Vocabulary

	3a) Those two go hand in hand so I figured the app should just show the Kanji versions
		of words and phrases and then their translations. After all, if the user can read
		the Kanji versions, then the user can read the Hiragana and Katakana versions also.
		
	3b) This is the part that will be worked on the most from here on. At this point,
		I am simply finding new Kanji and vocabulary to add. I have ideas of what to 
		do, I just have to do them.
